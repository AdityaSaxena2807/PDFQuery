# PDFQuery

**PDFQuery** is a full-stack web application that enables users to upload PDF documents and interactively ask questions about their content. The system processes these documents and utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide accurate answers to user queries.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload PDF documents to the application for processing.
- **Interactive Q&A:** After uploading, users can pose questions related to the content of the PDFs.
- **NLP Processing:** The backend leverages advanced NLP models to interpret and answer questions based on the document content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A responsive and intuitive frontend facilitates seamless user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **NLP Processing:** LangChain or LLamaIndex
- **Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL (for storing document metadata)
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for storing uploaded PDFs

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `backend`: Contains the FastAPI backend code responsible for handling file uploads, processing documents, and answering queries.
- `frontend`: Contains the React.js frontend code that provides the user interface for uploading documents and interacting with the system.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL (if opting for PostgreSQL over SQLite)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the database:**

   - For SQLite (default):
     - The database file will be created automatically in the project directory.
   - For PostgreSQL:
     - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the backend configuration to point to your PostgreSQL instance.

5. **Run database migrations (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Start the FastAPI server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install the required npm packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF Document:**
   - Navigate to the frontend application.
   - Use the upload feature to select and upload a PDF document.

2. **Ask Questions:**
   - After uploading, enter your question related to the content of the PDF.
   - Submit the question to receive an answer generated by the NLP model.

3. **View Answers:**
   - The application will display the answer to your question.
   - You can continue to ask follow-up questions or upload new documents as needed.
